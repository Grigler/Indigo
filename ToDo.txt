- Change AABB to use min-max implementation
	- The current center-point size thing is stupid and unwieldly

- Put AABB around the camera using the frustum and use that for cheap frustum culling

-There seems to be an issue with how the shaders files are read in using the release build.
	- I might need to handle the files in a more C++ way (sstream?)
