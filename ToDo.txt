TODO
====

- Mouse control for character movement has shown how horribly inaccurate the transform getter functionality
is, so this definitely needs to be revisited now that I've relearnt how to use matricies and vectors properly

- Replace frustum point extraction to use variable near/far distances

- Work on getting some nice drag forces going - look into how to properly implement impulse forces as opposed to continuous
  - A force generator system seem to be the intuitive solution
  
- Interpenetration handling
  - Look at ~pg 360 in your book, that describes what you need to do
