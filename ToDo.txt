- Rendering Management
	- I know that I should not be buffering data in and out multiple times for no reason
	so maybe I should just create vectors of GOs with identical meshes and then batch it that way?

	- An extra step and would result in a lot of management, probably could be done as it is loaded in
	rather than having to do it every draw call the same way every time

- Finish getting SOMETHING to render - namely the MeshRenderer-Draw function to get it working properly
	- Probably should move bind uniforms and such to the Shader Class (Create a generic meshRenderer Shader)
