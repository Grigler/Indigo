TODO
====

- Brush up on the concept of VAOs and work out whether it should belong to either
	- Mesh
	- MeshResource and given to mesh on assignment
	- MeshRenderer

- Rendering Management
	- I know that I should not be buffering data in and out multiple times for no reason
	so maybe I should just create vectors of GOs with identical meshes and then batch it that way?

	- An extra step and would result in a lot of management, probably could be done as it is loaded in
	rather than having to do it every draw call the same way every time
